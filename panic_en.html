      <dt>What times are displayed ?</dt>
      <dd>By default, the application shows times in the coming two
      hours. In real time mode, only times in the next hour are displayed.</dd>
      <dt>See the previous or next schedule</dt>
      <dd>You can double-tap on the left (or right) hand side to see
      the previous (next) schedule.</dd>
      <dt>See the schedule at a different date</dt>
      <dd>You can use the clock button to select a different date.</dd>
      <dt>What does the arrow means on the favorites ?</dt>
      <dd>The arrow represents the global direction (west, south...)
      of the indicated trip.</dd>
      <dt>Different between arrival and departure</dt>
      <dd>In some cases, there can be a difference between the arrival
        of the bus at the stop and its departure. You can choose what
        time to display globally via the preferences.<br />
        On the main grid, a long tap allows to switch between the
        different possibilities.</dd>
      <dt>See your time of arrival</dt>
      <dd>On the grid, by taping on a trip date, you will be shown
        the arrival times for the remainder of the trip.</dd>
      <dt>Real time schedule</dt>
      <dd>On the grid, you can use the central button to toggle the
        real time information. (Requires a working internet
        connection).</dd>
      <dt>Order for the listing of stops</dt>
      <dd>Well, yeah, only an alphabetical order is available, as
        displaying them in the order of the trips is a bit more
        tricky (for example, some lines may have different trips for
        some reasons).</dd>

	<p>The application displays schedules for a period of two hours. If there's no
	  travel at the date, a message will invite you to select a different period.</p>
	<p>You can select a different period, with either the clock button or by using 
	  a double-tap on the left-most (respectivly right-most) column.</p>
	<p>Regarding the favorites, the arrow indicates the general direction (West, East,...)
	  of the corresponding travel. Only the 5 most consulted favorites are displayed
